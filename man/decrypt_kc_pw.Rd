\description{
Get a generic password from OSX Keychain using the 'security' cli
}
\details{
Passwords must be saved in Keychain prior to using the function.

OSX may require the user to grant access to "security" the first time the function
is run for each password.  It is important to select "Always allow", which will
prevent similar dialogs in the future.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# First store a password in Keychain
# now return the password above to the R environment
x <- decrypt_kc_pw("label")

# function is best used in a connection string command:
ch <- odbcConnect("some dsn", uid = "user1", pwd = decrypt_kc_pw("mydb_myuser"))
}
}
