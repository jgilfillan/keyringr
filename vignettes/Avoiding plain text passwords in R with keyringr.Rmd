Connecting to a database to read and write data is a common task in R.  Usually, a password is required to create the database connection, however typing plain text passwords into R scripts is poor practice.  The keyringr package uses the operating system's encryption features to supply credentials to R.  Windows (via the Windows Data Protection API), OSX (via Keychain) and Linux (via the Gnome Keyring) are supported.

The package defines three functions - one for each supported OS:

  * Windows - `decrypt_dpapi_pw(file)`
  * Linux - `decrypt_gk_pw(key_value_pairs)`
  * OSX - `decrypt_kc_pw(label, type = "generic")`

All three functions return an invisible string.  A typical use case can be seen below.

```{r eval=FALSE}
decrypt_dpapi_pw("test.txt")
```
